<h1 id="jump-rope-freestyle-score-calculator">Jump Rope Freestyle Score Calculator</h1>
<p>A useful program for calculating the score of a jump rope routine under the IJRU Rulebook. Includes minimum and maximum scores with presentation as a whole, and each part(Entertainment, Execution, Musicality, Creativity, and Variety). Input the levels of the skills in your routine, and get back a comprehensive analysis of how your routine will score. Scoring calculations taken from <a href="https://rules.ijru.sport/technical-manual/calculations/freestyle/single-rope">IJRU Technical Manual 4.0.0</a></p>
