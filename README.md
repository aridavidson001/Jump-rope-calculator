# Jump Rope Freestyle Score Calculator


A useful program for calculating the score of a jump rope routine under the IJRU Rulebook. Includes minimum and maximum scores with presentation as a whole, and each part(Entertainment, Execution, Musicality, Creativity, and Variety). Input the levels of the skills in your routine, and get back a comprehensive analysis of how your routine will score. Scoring calculations taken from [IJRU Technical Manual 4.0.0](https://rules.ijru.sport/technical-manual/calculations/freestyle/single-rope)

### Gymnastics and Power Modifiers
> - +1 for Criss-cross performed with power or gymnastics skills and/or flips
> 
> - +1 to the level of a multiple landing in Push-up, Split or Crab position ()
> 
> - +2 to the level of the starting skill if landing in a frog position
> 
> - +1 for assisted flips without supporting interaction
> 
> - -1 for assisted flips with supporting interactions all the way around
> 
> - +1 for every 90-degree turn in power when the rope is pulled (90° = +1, 180° = +2, 270° = +3, etc.)
> 
> - -1 for gymnastics with rope held with only one hand and not jumping the rope (for example, one-hand handspring (L2) with both handles in one hand (-1) = L1; front aerial (L3) with both handles in one hand (-1) = L2)

### Multiples Modifiers
> - +1 for body rotation more than 270° in twist or flip direction (for example, EK, BC, full twist)
> 
> - +1 for every additional 180° turned in the air beyond a 360° turn when jumped. (540° = total +2, 720° = total +3, 900° = total +4, etc.)
> 
### Rope Manipulation Modifiers
> - +1 for switch crosses (AS×AS, criss-cross×criss-cross, AS×CL as long as the arm on top changes, etc.)
> 
> - +1 per layer for go-go's/crazy criss-cross (one hand crosses twice across body, leg or arm without uncrossing)
> 
> - +1 (max +3) per extra wrap layer for wraps
> 
> - +1 for changing the direction of rope movement in the air (Note, skills like EK where the rope continues in the same direction but the athlete turns doesn't count)
> 
> - +1 for switching handles
> 
> - +1 for transition jumps (jumping a one-hand restricted skill and in one jump, jumping the opposite side one-hand restricted skill, such as crougar-crougar)
> 
> - +1 for each restricted arm catching the release when catching a release in a one-arm restricted position
> 
> - +1 to the release for releasing a handle in a restricted position if, and only if, the hand is completely behind the body (behind the back or behind both legs)
> 
> - +1 for catching a release with something other than a hand (such as scooping the rope, squeezing it with a body part, or landing the rope on a foot, shoulder, or similar, jumping the rope with the rope caught on a body part)
